# LogDeck
A simple C++ logging facility.

This code grew out of a need for logging in my game GravityJam. I realized that I wanted to do some logging for debugging purposes, and 
that I also wanted some of the same information to be routed into a database for other purposes. So I thought I might be able to mash these
together. Also, I've been looking at a smaller project to "spin off" of the larger game. 

Further comments on the purpose and use of LogDeck will be added as it is developed

I know some very excellent pieces of code exist for logging, but I wanted to write some myself as an exercise in handling strings/streams, 
time, file i/o, using vi, and also cross-plaform autotool based development. Comments and suggestions are welcome. 

FYI - A Log Deck is used in sawmills to stage logs in "queue" to be fed (often by gravity) into a machine. Logdecking is an event in competitive 
logging in which the loading of a log on a deck by a pair of woodsmen is the object. A "deck log" is the technical term for the "ship's log" 
that is kept on commissioned vessels of the US Navy.
