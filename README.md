# LogDeck
A simple C++ logging facility.

This code grew out of a need for logging in my game GravityJam. I decided to
make it a seperate project and make it pretty general so that I could reuse it
easily, and extend it as needed. Further comments on the purpose and use of 
LogDeck will be added as it is developed. Comments and suggestions are welcome.
  
FYI - A Log Deck is used in sawmills to stage logs in "queue" to be fed (often by gravity) into a machine. Logdecking is an event in competitive 
logging in which the loading of a log on a deck by a pair of woodsmen is the object. A "deck log" is also the technical term for the "ship's log" 
that is kept on commissioned vessels of the US Navy.
